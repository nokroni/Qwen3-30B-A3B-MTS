2,GENHX,"A 51-year-old white male diagnosed with PTLD in latter half of 2007.  He presented with symptoms of increasing adenopathy, abdominal pain, weight loss, and anorexia.  He did not seek medical attention immediately.  He was finally hospitalized by the renal transplant service and underwent a lymph node biopsy in the groin, which showed diagnosis of large cell lymphoma.  He was discussed at the hematopathology conference.  Chemotherapy with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, daunorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone was started.  First cycle of chemotherapy was complicated by sepsis despite growth factor support.  He also appeared to have become disoriented either secondary to sepsis or steroid therapy. The patient has received 5 cycles of chemotherapy to date.  He did not keep his appointment for a PET scan after 3 cycles because he was not feeling well.  His therapy has been interrupted for infection related to squamous cell cancer, skin surgery as well as complaints of chest infection. The patient is here for the sixth and final cycle of chemotherapy.  He states he feels well.  He denies any nausea, vomiting, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain or fatigue.

107,GENHX,"She is a very pleasant 59-year-old nurse with a history of breast cancer.  She was initially diagnosed in June 1994.  Her previous treatments included Zometa, Faslodex, and Aromasin.  She was found to have disease progression first noted by rising tumor markers.  PET/CT scan revealed metastatic disease and she was enrolled in clinical trial of CTSU/C40502.  She was randomized to the ixabepilone plus Avastin.  She experienced dose-limiting toxicity with the fourth cycle.  The Ixempra was skipped on day 1 and day 8.  She then had a dose reduction and has been tolerating treatment well with the exception of progressive neuropathy.  Early in the month she had concerned about possible perforated septum.  She was seen by ENT urgently.  She was found to have nasal septum intact.  She comes into clinic today for day eight Ixempra.","Doctor: Good afternoon, ma'am, I just need some information before we get started today. 
Patient: Absolutely, good afternoon, doctor. 
Doctor: My chart says here that you're fifty nine years old, is that correct? 
Patient: Yes, that's correct. 
Doctor: I also see that you have a history of breast cancer, is that correct as well?
Patient: Yes, that's also correct. 
Doctor: When were you diagnosed initially? 
Patient: Um, I was diagnosed in June of nineteen ninety four. 
Doctor: How has this been managed in the past, ma'am? 
Patient: Um, I've taken Zometa, Faslodex, and Aromasin. 
Doctor: How has the cancer progressed since you were diagnosed? 
Patient: The doctors said I had rising tumor markers. 
Doctor: What imaging have you done to evaluate the cancer? 
Patient: I've had a P E T C T Scan done. 
Doctor: What did that scan show?
Patient: It showed that the cancer was metastatic. 
Doctor: I see here that you were involved in a clinical trial for your breast cancer, can you tell me more about that, please? 
Patient: I was in the C T S U C four zero five zero two trial, and I was randomized into the ixabepilone plus Avastin group. 
Doctor: How did you respond to this treatment? 
Patient: Um, I had something called dose limiting toxicity with the fourth cycle. I skipped the Ixempra on the first and eighth days. 
Doctor: How did they respond once this happened? 
Patient: They just reduced the dose I was given. 
Doctor: How did you handle this reduced dose? 
Patient: Honestly, I've been tolerating the treatment pretty well. I only have some neuropathy. 
Doctor: Do you have any other concerns of note? 
Patient: Um, I thought that I had a perforated septum earlier this month, and I went to my E N T right away, but everything was okay. There was no perforation. 
Doctor: Okay, so, you're here for your eighth day of Ixempra, correct? 
Patient: Yes, doctor, that's correct."
112,GENHX,"The patient is a 62-year-old white female with multiple chronic problems including hypertension and a lipometabolism disorder.  She follows with Dr. XYZ on her hypertension, as well as myself.  She continues to gain weight.  Diabetes is therefore a major concern.  In fact, her dad had diabetes and she has a brother who has diabetes.  The patient also has several additional concerns she brings up today.  One is that her left knee continues to bother her and it hurts.  She cannot really isolate where the pain is, it just seems to hurt through her knee.  She has had this for some time now and in fact as we reviewed her records, her left knee has been x-rayed in 1999.  There was some minimal narrowing of the weightbearing joint with some minor hypertrophic spurring medially.  She would like to have this x-rayed again today.  She is certainly not interested in any surgery.  She has noted that it particularly hurts to kneel.  In addition, she complains of her stools being a baby-yellow.  She has rectal bleeding off and on.  It is bright red.  She had a colonoscopy done in 1999.  She does have a family history of colon cancer questionable in her mother, who is deceased.  She complains of some diffuse abdominal pain off and on.  She has given up fast foods and her pop and this has not seemed to help.  She does admit however, that she is not eating right.  Sometimes her stools are hard.  Sometimes they are runny.  The blood does not really seem to be related to necessarily a hard stool.  It is always bright red and will sometimes drip into the toilet.  Over the last couple of days, she had also been sneezing and has had an itchy throat.  She tried some Claritin and this did not help.  She has had some body aches.  She is finally feeling better today with this.  She also is questioning whether she has some sleep apnea.  She will awaken suddenly in the middle of the night.  She was told that she does snore.  She does not smoke.  As stated, she has gained significant weight.","Doctor: Hello, miss. What brings you into our clinic today? Also, before we start, it looks like you forgot to fill out your ethnicity on the new patient paperwork. Do you mind telling me what you identify as?
 Patient: Hello, doctor. I am white and I am a young sixty two years old. I have a list of issues I would like to talk about. 
Doctor: Let's begin. I know that you have been dealing with hypertension and lipometabolism disorder. Doctor X Y Z and I follow you on the hypertension. What else do we have going on?
Patient: First off I have a history of diabetes in my family. My father had it and my brother has it currently. I am afraid because I know I have gained some weight. My knee also has been hurting for a long time. The left knee. 
Doctor: Can you locate where the pain is?
Patient: I think it is everywhere in the knee. It hurts to kneel. I had imaging done on it a while ago. Can you check to see the results?  
Doctor: Ah, yes. We have on file that you had an X Ray done in nineteen ninety nine. I see that a joint is narrowing. We can talk about possible surgery. 
Patient: Can I have it x rayed again? I don't want any surgery, but I want to know what is going on. I am afraid of surgery. 
Doctor: Let's see what else I can do. Any other issues?
Patient: Yes. I am very concerned because my poop is baby yellow and I have some rectal bleeding occasionally. It is always bright red and drips into the toilet. My last colonoscopy was in nineteen ninety nine. 
Doctor: Do you have any history of colon cancer?
Patient: I do not, but I think my mother did. She is gone now, so I cannot check. Do you think my poop is baby yellow because of my stomach pain? I have some stomach pain and have been laying off the fast food and soda, but it doesn't seem to work. Sometimes my poop is hard or runny. It is always random. 
Doctor: Do you bleed when the stool is hard?
Patient: Not really. Oh, and lastly, I had cold symptoms. Like a sore throat and I was sneezing a lot. I think it was a cold or flu because Claritin did not work. I think the body aches were also from this illness. I feel okay today, but I wanted to bring this up just in case it had to do with my stool being discolored. During this sick period I also am wondering if I have sleep apnea because I wake up in the middle of the night randomly. 
Doctor: Do you snore? That is a sign of sleep apnea. Smoking also can contribute to restlessness.
Patient: No I do not snore and I do not smoke."

We have been fairly aggressively, downwardly adjusting her insulins, both the Lantus insulin, which we had been giving at night as well as her sliding scale Humalog insulin prior to meals.  Despite frequent decreases in her insulin regimen, she continues to have somewhat low blood glucoses, most notably in the morning when the glucoses have been in the 70s despite decreasing her Lantus insulin from around 84 units down to 60 units, which is a considerable change.  What I cannot explain is why her glucoses have not really climbed at all despite the decrease in insulin.  The staff reports to me that her appetite is good and that she is eating as well as ever.  I talked to Anna today.  She feels a little fatigued.  Otherwise, she is doing well.","Doctor: Good afternoon, Anna.

129,GENHX,"The patient is a 63-year-old left-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of multiple neurological symptoms.  I asked him to discuss each symptom individually as he had a very hard time describing the nature of his problems.  He first mentioned that he has neck pain.  He states that he has had this for at least 15 years.  It is worse with movement.  It has progressed very slowly over the course of 15 years.  It is localized to the base of his neck and is sharp in quality.  He also endorses a history of gait instability.  This has been present for a few years and has been slightly progressively worsening.  He describes that he feels unsteady on his feet and ""walks like a duck.""  He has fallen about three or four times over the past year and a half. He also describes that he has numbness in his feet.  When I asked him to describe this in more detail, the numbness is actually restricted to his toes.  Left is slightly more affected than the right.  He denies any tingling or paresthesias.  He also described that he is slowly losing control of his hands.  He thinks that he is dropping objects due to weakness or incoordination in his hands.  This has also been occurring for the past one to two years.  He has noticed that buttoning his clothes is more difficult for him.  He also does not have any numbness or tingling in the hands.  He does have a history of chronic low back pain. At the end of the visit, when I asked him which symptom was most bothersome to him, he actually stated that his fatigue was most troublesome.  He did not even mention this on the initial part of my history taking.  When I asked him to describe this further, he states that he experiences a general exhaustion.  He basically lays in bed all day everyday.  I asked him if he was depressed, he states that he is treated for depression.  He is unsure if this is optimally treated.  As I just mentioned, he stays in bed almost all day long and does not engage in any social activities.  He does not think that he is necessarily sad.  His appetite is good.  He has never undergone any psychotherapy for depression. When I took his history, I noticed that he is very slow in responding to my questions and also had a lot of difficulty recalling details of his history as well as names of physicians who he had seen in the past.  I asked if he had ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties and he states that he did undergo testing at Johns Hopkins a couple of years ago.  He states that the results were normal and that specifically he did not have any dementia. When I asked him when he was first evaluated for his current symptoms, he states that he saw Dr. X several years ago.  He believes that he was told that he had neuropathy but that it was unclear if it was due to his diabetes.  He told me that more recently he was evaluated by you after Dr. Y referred him for this evaluation.  He also saw Dr. Z for neurosurgical consultation a couple of weeks ago.  He reports that she did not think there was any surgical indication in his neck or back at this point in time.","Doctor: Welcome back, sir!

Doctor: Has the pain been progressing over the years or has it been the same? 
Patient: It is worse right now. 
Doctor: When did the pain become worse? 
Patient: I don't know. It has been getting more painful since it started. Little by little. 
Doctor: Where is the pain? 
Patient: It's in my neck. 
Doctor: Can you show me where the pain in the neck is coming from?

Patient: It hurts.
Doctor: Mean is the pain sharp or dull? 
Patient: It is sharp.

Doctor: How long have you been experiencing this for? 
Patient: It had been a few years. 
Doctor: Has it become worse over that time? 
Patient: A little. I am so clumsy now. I fell about three or four times recently. 
Doctor: How recently? 
Patient: I have been no feeling in my, um feet.
Doctor: Can you describe it? Is it numbness? 
Patient: I said, no feeling. 
Doctor: What part of your feet is it affecting? 
Patient: It is not the whole foot. Just the toes. The left toes are worse than the right ones. 
Doctor: Let me take a look. I am just going to remove your socks.
Patient: Okay. 
Doctor: How long has this been happening? 
Patient: I don't know. Maybe a year or no, um.  I think maybe the last year and a half.
Doctor: Have you had any tingling or abnormal sensations?

Patient: It is the same. It's still here in my low back. 
Doctor: Do you have any other concerns today? 
Patient: I have been dropping things. 
Doctor: What do you mean dropping things? 
Patient: I can't hold on to things. I drop things. I grab on to something and then I can't keep ahold of it. 
Doctor: How long has this been happening for? 
Patient: Um. I guess the same amount of time. 
Doctor: The same amount of time as your feet? 
Patient: Yes. A year or two. I wasn't always this bad. It has been getting worse this whole time. 
Doctor: So, it has been getting worse with time. 
Patient: Yes. I am slowly losing control of my hands. Buttoning my clothes is really hard for me now.  
Doctor: I am so sorry to hear that. Have you had any tingling or numbness in your hands? 
Patient: No. I just can't do things like I used to. 
Doctor: Which one of your symptoms is the most bothersome to you? 
Patient: The most? Um well, I am really worn down all the time. 
Doctor: Can you elaborate on the worn down? 
Patient: I am exhausted all the time for no reason or the other. 
Doctor: I am glad you mentioned this to me before I let you go today. 
Patient: Yeah. All I do is just lay in bed all day everyday. 
Doctor: Are you having feelings of depression? 
Patient: Yes, I have depression. 
Doctor: Are you being treated for your depression? 
Patient: Yes. I don't think that it is working. I mean, all I do is stay in bed all day. 
Doctor: Do you have any company or do any socializing? 
Patient: No. I don't ever feel like it anymore. I am exhausted! I am not necessarily sad. 
Doctor: How is your appetite? 
Patient: Appetite? 
Doctor: Yes. Have you been eating well? 
Patient: No problem there. 
Doctor: Have you ever seen a psychotherapist for your depression?
Patient: Psychotherapist?
Doctor: Like a therapist or a counselor? 
Patient: No nothing like that.
Doctor: I noticed that your responses are a little bit delayed and you're having difficulty with your memory. Have you ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties? 
 Patient: Um they did a test. 
Doctor: Who did a test? How long ago was that? 
Patient: Um, it was at the Hopkins place. 
Doctor: John Hopkins? 
Patient: Yeah, that's the one. It was a couple of years ago.  
Doctor: What were the results of the test that they did?
Patient: Normal. A guy said that, that I don't have dementia.
Doctor: He said that specifically? 
Patient: Yeah, that's what he said no dementia. I first saw Doctor X years ago he told me I had something called, neuropathy because of my diabetes. I am not sure what that is.
Doctor: How long ago was that?
Patient: A very long time ago. And then I just saw that other doctor oh what's his name it starts with a Y. Doctor Y this time. 
Doctor: Hum? 
Patient: I also saw the neuro guy. My new one. That was a couple of weeks ago.
Doctor: What is his name?
Patient: Whose name?
Doctor: The neuro guy you saw a couple of weeks ago?
Patient: Oh, I can't remember maybe Doctor Z I think.
Doctor: What did this Doctor Z say after your evaluation?
Patient: He said he didn't think I need surgery on my neck or back at this time.

He was playing basketball in Angola back last Wednesday, Month DD, YYYY, when he was driving toward the basket and felt a pop in his posterior leg.  He was seen locally and diagnosed with an Achilles tendon rupture.  He has been on crutches and has been nonweightbearing since that time. He had no pain prior to his injury.  He has had some swelling that is mild.  He has just been on aspirin a day due to his traveling time.  Pain currently is minimal.","Doctor: Good afternoon, Mister X Y Z, how are you today?

Doctor: How have you been treated for this so far?

Doctor: Did you have any pain before the injury?
Patient: No sir, none at all. 
Doctor: Have you taken any medicine for this?
Patient: I just take an aspirin a day, because I've been traveling so much.

145,GENHX,"This is a followup for this 69-year-old African American gentleman with stage IV chronic kidney disease secondary to polycystic kidney disease.  His creatinine has ranged between 4 and 4.5 over the past 6 months, since I have been following him.  I have been trying to get him educated about end-stage kidney disease and we have been unsuccessful in getting him into classes.  On his last visit, I really stressed the importance of him taking his medications adequately and not missing some of the doses, and he returns today with much better blood pressure control.  He has also brought a machine at home, and states his blood pressure readings have been better.  He has not gone to the transplant orientation class yet and has not been to dialysis education yet, and both of these I have discussed with him in the past.  He also needs followup for his elevated PSA in the past, which has not been done for over 2 years and will likely need cardiac clearance if we ever are able to evaluate him for transplant.","Doctor: Good morning, sir, I hear someone just had a birthday. 
Patient: Good morning, I just turned sixty nine. 
Doctor: Congratulations on another year! 
Patient: Thank you, doctor. 
Doctor: So, I have a resident with me today, I'm just going to run over your background information with her really quick, is that okay, sir?
Patient: Sure, that's no problem. 
Doctor: Great, thank you. So, this is an African American gentleman who has stage four C K D secondary to P K D. He's had a high creatinine level over the last six months, so we've been following him closely. 
Patient: Yes, that's all correct, doctor. 
Doctor: Have you been going to the end stage kidney disease classes? 
Patient: No, I haven't been able to get in yet. 
Doctor: We've talked about how important it is for you to take your blood pressure medication, have you been doing that? 
Patient: Yes, and look at the reading from today. 
Doctor: Yes, this is much better. Good job! Have you gone to the transplant orientation classes?
Patient: No, not yet.
Doctor: How about dialysis education classes? 
Patient: No, I haven't been to those either. 
Doctor: Sir, we've talked about this, it's important for you to get into these classes. 
Patient: I know, doctor. 
Doctor: Okay, well, we need to follow up his P S A today, it's been about two years since the last time. 
Patient: Why do you need that?
Doctor: Well, we'll most likely need cardiac clearance if we're ever able to see if you can get a transplant."

162,GENHX,"The patient is a 45-year-old African-American female whose symptoms first started some one and a half years ago with pain in the left shoulder and some neck pain.  This has subsequently resolved.  She started vigorous workouts in November 2005.  In March of this year, she suddenly could not feel her right foot on the bathroom floor and subsequently went to her primary care physician.  By her report, she had a nerve conduction study and a diagnosis of radiculopathy was made.  She had an MRI of lumbosacral spine, which was within normal limits.  She then developed a tingling sensation in the right middle toe.  Symptoms progressed to sensory symptoms of her knees, elbows, and left middle toe.  She then started getting sensory sensations in the left hand and arm.  She states that she feels a little bit wobbly at the knees and that she is slightly dragging her left leg.  Symptoms have been mildly progressive.  She is unaware of any trigger other than the vigorous workouts as mentioned above.  She has no associated bowel or bladder symptoms.  No particular position relieves her symptoms. Workup has included two MRIs of the C-spine, which were personally reviewed and are discussed.  She saw you for consultation and the possibility of surgical decompression was raised.  At this time, she is somewhat reluctant to go through any surgical procedure.","Doctor: Good afternoon, ma'am.

Patient: The pain actually went away all on its own once, but now I have pain in my right foot.
Doctor: Is there any injury that you can remember?
Patient: No, but I started working out really hard in November of two thousand and five. 
Doctor: Have these symptoms progressed? 
Patient: Well, in March of this year I couldn't feel my right foot on the bathroom floor one day, so I immediately called my P C P. 
Doctor: How did your P C P handle this?
Patient: She scheduled an, um, a nerve conduction study. 
Doctor: Do you remember the results of that study?
Patient: I have the report right here, take a look, please.
Doctor: Ah yes, radiculopathy, do you have any numbness or tingling into the legs or feet? 
Patient: Yes, it started tingling in my right middle toe, and then it began in my knees and left middle toe. Then, it even moved into my elbows, which was really concerning. 
Doctor: Did you have any other imagine done? 
Patient: Yes, I had an MRI of the lower back, take a look. 
Doctor: Yes, I see, everything looks normal here, and the report supports that. Okay, do you have any weakness or feelings of instability in the legs? 
Patient: Yes, my legs feel kind of wobbly, like at the knees, and I feel like I can't totally pick up my left leg. 
Doctor: Are these symptoms getting worse?
Patient: Yes, a little bit at a time, but it's definitely getting worse.

Doctor: Are you having any trouble going to the bathroom?
Patient: No, absolutely not, everything is normal. 
Doctor: When you lay in bed, are any positions more comfortable than others?

178,GENHX,This is a 36-year-old Caucasian female with a long-standing history of right knee pain.  She has been diagnosed in the past with chondromalacia patella.  She has failed conservative therapy.  It was discussed with her the possibility of a arthroscopy lateral release and a tubercle transfer (anterior medialization of the tibial tubercle) to release stress from her femoral patellofemoral joint.  She elected to proceed with the surgical intervention.  All risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with her.  She was in agreement with the treatment plan.,"Doctor: Good morning, ma'am.

Patient: Well, I've had pain in this right knee for a long time. 
Doctor: Have you been treated for this before? 
Patient: Yes, and I've been diagnosed with, um, chondromalacia. 
Doctor: How have you been treated so far? 
Patient: I've taken antiinflammatories, rested, changed my activities, all of that. 
Doctor: Has there been any improvement? 
Patient: No, none at all. 
Doctor: Have you discussed surgery with anyone before. 
Patient: No, nobody's said anything yet. 
Doctor: Well, I think you'd be a good candidate for an arthroscopy lateral release and tubercle transfer. 
Patient: What will the surgery do?
Doctor: This will help take some stress off of the knee joint. It should help you feel a lot better. 
Patient: What are the risks of infection from the surgery, doctor?
Doctor: Well, you'll be relieved to know that it's less than one percent. We use prophylactic antibiotics the entire time. 
Patient: Will I be asleep for this?
Doctor: Yes, you won't feel a thing.

185,GENHX,"This is a 62-year-old right-handed now left-handed white female with tremor since 5th grade.  She remembers that the tremors started in her right hand around that time subsequently later on in early 20s she was put on propranolol for the tremor and more recently within the last 10 years she has been put on primidone and clonazepam.  She thinks that her clonazepam is helping her a lot especially with anxiety and stress, and this makes the tremor better.  She has a lot of trouble with her writing because of tremor but does not report as much problem with other activities of daily living like drinking from a cup and doing her day-to-day activity.  Since around 6 to 7 years, she has had a head tremor, which is mainly ""no- no"" and occasional voice tremor also.  Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura, which are far and few apart.  She also has some stress incontinence.  Last MRI brain was done in 2001 reportedly normal.","Doctor: Happy belated birthday! I see that you recently turned sixty two years old.
Patient: Thank you so much. I appreciate the birthday wishes.
Doctor: You're very welcome. I have a few questions to ask before we begin. Are you right or left handed?
Patient: Interesting story. I used to be right handed but now I write with my left. 
Doctor: I see. And you identify as a white female?
Patient: Yes. 
Doctor: When were you first diagnosed with tremors?
Patient: Fifth grade so a long, long time ago. They actually started in my right hand. They placed me on Propranolol for tremors in my early twenties. 
Doctor: Are you taking propranolol currently?
Patient: I'm now taking primidone and clonazepam.
Doctor: When did you switch?
Patient: Within the last ten years or so.
Doctor: Have you noticed any improvement?
Patient: I'd say so. Clonazepam has been helping my anxiety and stress. I think it's improved my tremors as a result. But I'm still having a lot of difficulties writing due to my tremors. 
Doctor: Are you finding that your tremors are interfering with other daily living activities, such as drinking or washing the dishes?
Patient: Um not so much. I'm able to do day-to-day activities without as great of trouble. I'm wondering if it's because I need to keep an extra steady hand while writing. For about six to seven years now, I've developed a head tremor. I shake my head back and forth.
Doctor: Do you have any voice tremors?
Patient: I do.
Doctor: I see here that you were recently diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura. How often do you experience these migraines?
Patient: Once in a blue moon. Unrelated, but I forgot to mention that I experience stress incontinence here and there, too.
Doctor: I see. When did you last have an M R I?
Patient: Two thousand one.
Doctor: Do you remember if it was normal or abnormal?
Patient: Normal from what I recall. Nothing crazy."
